## General localization guidelines
You need to update localization files separately for the old and new Ovation Green applications â€“ web application and SCADA and for different versions starting from 5.8.0. 
_**Note:**_ 
Make sure to check out the corresponding branch (5.8.0, 5.8.1, and so on) before you make any changes. 
When there is an update that relates to more than one version of Ovation Green, first, update the oldest version, create a commit and push changes for the following one, then, repeat these actions for the version that comes after, and so on until this update is in all of the versions. This way, you minimize conflicts and manual work.
